## Evaluations
### Homework
* Due on 24 October 2023
* Homework assignments are counted for 20% of your final grade.
* The homework should be done in jupyter notebook [here](MATH60629A_Homework.ipynb) or Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davoodwadi/MATH60629A.A2023-MACHINE-LEARNING-I/blob/main/MATH60629A_Homework.ipynb).

* **Instructions**:
    + The homework is due by 11:59PM EST on the due date. 
    + Please upload a PDF version of your assignment on ZoneCours and insert the shareable link to your notebook in the same interface.
    + Homeworks must be completed individually. 
        - Discussion with others is okay, but you must write solutions yourself.
    + All code used to arrive at answers is submitted along with answers.
    + **Notes:**
        - Please provide your code answers in the code block under each question and verbal answers in text boxes assigned in the notebook (where applicable).
        - Please run the notebook before the submission so that the outputs are displayed.
        - Please make sure that your results are reproducible. You may use random seeds from `random` and `numpy` packages. For `scikit-learn` modules, you may use the `random_state` argument.
