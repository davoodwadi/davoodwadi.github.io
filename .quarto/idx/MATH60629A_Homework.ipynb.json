Please upload a PDF\nversion of your assignment on ZoneCours.\n- The homework is worth 20% of the course’s final grade.\n- Assignments are to be done individually.\n\n- Please provide your code answers in the code block under each question and verbal answers in text boxes assigned in the notebook (where applicable).\n- Please run the notebook before the submission so that the outputs are displayed.\n- Please make sure that your results are reproducible. You may use random seeds from `random` and `numpy` packages. For `scikit-learn` modules, you may use the `random_state` argument.\n\n# Classification **(7pt)**\nWe will use a synthetic dataset. It is available [here](https://github.com/davoodwadi/MATH60629A.A2023-MACHINE-LEARNING-I/raw/main/data/a22_devoir_q2-classification.npz).\n\nOnce the data are accessible from your current working directory, you can\nload them using the following code:\n\n`data = np.load(\"a22_devoir_q2-classification.npz\")`\n\n`X = data[\"X\"]`\n\n`y = data[\"y\"]`\n\n**Exploratory Data Analysis**\n\n1. (**0.5pt**) Plot the features, X, and color each datum based on its class. (*Hint:* You may use the `hue` argument in the `seaborn` package.)\n\n\n2. (**0.5pt**) Based on the plot, is a classifier with a linear margin a good choice for this classification task?\n\n**answer**\n\n[____]\n\n**3. (1pt) Split you data into *training*, *validation*, and *test* sets.**\n- Use 60% of the data for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing\n- If using `train_test_split` function from `scikit-learn`, use `random state=1234`\n\n4. **(1pt)** Explore the distribution of the classes in the entire dataset, training set, validation set, and test set.\n\n5. **(0.5pt)** Is each subset balanced?\n\n\n**answer**\n\n[____]\n\n6. **(0.5pt)** How can the imbalance of each subset affect prediction accuracy?\n\n**answer**\n\n[____]\n\n7. **0.5** If the training/validation/test sets are not balanced, adjust your code to recreate balanced training/validation/test sets.\n\n*Hint:* You may use the `stratify` argument in the `train_test_split` function to help with the balance of the splits.\n\n## SVM for classfication\n\n8. **(1pt)** Train a linear SVM on the training set for each one of these C hyperparameter values: {0:001; 0:01; 0:1; 1; 10}. Find the best hyperparameter on the validation set.\n\n9. **(1pt)** Using the best hyperparameter C, evaluate the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.\n\n10. **(0.5pt)** Plot the confusion matrix on the test set and explain the reason for your false negatives/positives.\n\n**Observations**\n\n[_____]\n\n# Regression **(13pt)**\nYou will now train k-NN and neural network models for the task of predicting\nthe rating of a text review.\n\nThe data to download are **[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davoodwadi/MATH60629A.A2023-MACHINE-LEARNING-I/main/data/reviews.tsv)**.\n\nEach datum is a review in text format of an Amazon product.\nIn the data file, each line corresponds to a datum. Each datum contains a target (y) followed by a short text (x). The target variable is the rating given by a user to a product. It is an integer value between 1 and 5. The text is the review.\n\nTo pre-process the data you will first have to separate the targets from the features.\n*Hint: you can use the `split(’\\t’)` function. There are also functions in `pandas` that will allow you to easily load this dataset.*\n\nWe will model this task as a regression problem (you can use mean squared error to measure performance).\n1. **(0.5pt)** If we had decided to model this task as a classification problem with 5 classes, what are some of the metrics we could have used to measure performance?\n\n**answer**\n\n[_________________________]\n\n2. List one **(0.5pt)** advantage and one **(0.5pt)** disadvantage of instead modelling the problem as a classification problem with 5 classes.\n\n**answer**\n\nAdvantage:\n\n[____]\n\nDisadvantage:\n\n[____]\n\n\n\n3. **(0.5pt)** Divide the datasets into training (80% of the data), validation (10%), and test sets (10%). For this set the random seed to $1234$\n(`random state=1234`)\n\n4. **(2pt)** Now you must obtain a bag-of-words representation of the features.\nsklearn provides several functions for doing so.\n\nTo limit the required training time, please use a maximum of 2,000 words\nin your vocabulary (`max features=2000`) and the list of english stop words\nfrom sklearn (`stop words=\"english\"`). Words on this list will be automatically removed from the data since they are, a priori, less predictive for\nthe task at hand. Use the default value for all other function parameters.\n\n**k-nearest neighbours**\n5. **(0.5pt)** Which of the following three distance functions ‘cosine’, ’euclidean’,\nand ‘manhattan’ do you deem more appropriate for this problem? Please\njustify.\n\n**answer**\n[_________________________]\n\n6. **(1pt)** Train an appropriate k-NN model for this\ntask. We ask that you train models with 1, 10, 50, 100, and 1000 neighbours.\n\n7. **(0.5pt)** What is the performance of each model on the training and validation\nsets?\n\n**Observations**\n\n8. **(0.5pt)** What value of the hyperparameter provides the best results?\n\n**answer**\n\n[_________________________]\n\n**Neural Networks**\n\nUpon instantiating your neural networks, fix the random seed to 1234 (that is\n`random state=1234`).\n\n9. **(2pt)** You will now train a series of neural networks using different hyperparameters. Use the option `early_stopping=True` and find the hyperparameters that obtain the best results on the validation dataset (to give\nyou an idea, I imagine that you will train around 50 different models).\nI suggest that you explore the following three hyperarameters: *learning_rate*, *size of the network*, and *the strength of the L2 regularization term*.\n\n10. **(0.5pt)** Find the MSE on the test set for the best hyperparameter.\n\n 11. **(0.5pt)** What did you find out about the importance of the various hyperparameters?\n\n**answer**\n\n[_____]\n\n**Comparison**\n\n12. **(0.5pt)** Based on the neural network that you trained, if you were to keep a single feature (that is a single word), which one would it be and why?\n\n**answer**\n\n[_____]\n\n13. **(0.5pt)** What is the final performance of each model (k-NN, and neural\nnetwork)?\n\n14. **(1pt)** Find all the examples for which the prediction of the k-NN and the neural network differ by more than $2.0$.\n\n15. **(0.5pt)** Plot the distribution of the actual labels, and the predicted labels from k-NN and neural network.\n\n16. **(0.5pt)** Explain the reason behind the difference in prediction from k-NN and the actual labels.\n\n**answer**\n\n[_____]\n\n17. **(0.5pt)** Explain the reason behind the difference in prediction from the neural network and the actual labels.\n\n**answer**\n\n[_____]\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"MATH60629A_Homework.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
