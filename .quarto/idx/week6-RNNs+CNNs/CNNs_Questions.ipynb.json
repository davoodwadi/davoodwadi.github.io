As an example, consider the tiny 3x3 image below:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lcharlin/80-629/blob/master/week6-RNNs%2BCNNs/images/tiny.svg?raw=1\" width=\"150\" />\n\nThis is a grayscale image, which means that each pixel can be represented by a number between 0 and 255:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lcharlin/80-629/blob/master/week6-RNNs%2BCNNs/images/grid1.svg?raw=1\" width=\"150\" />\n\n\n## Applying a filter\n\nLet's see the effect of applying the *moving average* filter to this image. A moving average filter of size $k$ is a $k \\times k$ matrix where all entries are $1/k^2$. For example for $k=2$, the filter would be:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lcharlin/80-629/blob/master/week6-RNNs%2BCNNs/images/filter1.svg?raw=1\" width=\"100\" />\n\nAs you remember from the course, in order to apply a filter, we *move* it across the image and each time calculate the dot product between the filter and the corresponding region of the image. In this animation, the 4x4 image is in lighter blue, the 3x3 filter (k=3) is applied to the darker blue region, and the 2x2 result is the green part on top):\n\n<p>\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/lcharlin/80-629/blob/master/week6-RNNs%2BCNNs/images/slide_nostride_nopadding.gif?raw=1\" width=\"250\"/>\n    <figcaption style=\"text-align:center;font: italic small sans-serif\"> image source: <a href=\"http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/conv_arithmetic.html#no-zero-padding-unit-strides\">Theano documentation</a> </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>\n</p>\n\nApplying the filter to the lower left corner of the image leads to calculating the dot product $(20, 213, 60, 83)\\cdot(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25) = 94$:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lcharlin/80-629/blob/master/week6-RNNs%2BCNNs/images/apply1.svg?raw=1\" width=\"450\"/>\n\n\n### Exercise\nFill in values of the remaining three cells in the filtered image.  \n\n\n\n## Applying filters to real images\n\nWe will now apply two types of filter to an image, and see how they affect the image. We begin by loading and plotting the original image:\n\n### Moving average\nWe first apply the *moving average* filter:\n\nDue to the kernel operation, pixels on the left and top are lost (black areas)\n\n### Exercise\n1. What is the effect of applying the *moving average* filter?\n2. Change the value of $k$ to 10 and run the code again. What is the effect of this value?\n3. What does the following line in the code do?  `(image[r-k:r,c-k:c] * filter).sum()`\n\n## Let's create a function that would take an image and filter and return the result of applying that filter to the image.\n\n### Edge detection\nAs mentioned in the lectures, the *edge detection* filter has the form $(-1, 1)$ or $(1, -1)$. The code below applies these filters to the image:\n\n## Optional: alternative code\n\n## Sharpen filter (Laplacian mask)\n\n# Convolutional Neural Networks\n\nThe core building block of convolutional neural networks is the convolutional layer, which consists of a set of learnable filters. In previous parts of this document we saw how filters are applied to an image. In practice, by changing certain hyper-parameters, the filters can be applied differently. One of these hyper-parameters is *stride*.\n\n## Stride\n\nThe hyper-parameter *stride* controls the way that the filter slides on an image. When the stride is 1, the filter is moved one pixel at a time. When it's 2, the filter jumps 2 pixels in each move:\n\n<p>\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/lcharlin/80-629/blob/master/week6-RNNs%2BCNNs/images/slide_stride2_nopadding.gif?raw=1\" width=\"250\"/>\n    <figcaption style=\"text-align:center;font: italic small sans-serif\"> image source: <a href=\"http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/conv_arithmetic.html#no-zero-padding-non-unit-strides\">Theano documentation</a> </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n## MAX-Pooling layer\n\nRecall that the max-pooling layer reduces the size of the image by taking the max of values in the region that it covers. The pooling layers can also be applied with a stride.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lcharlin/80-629/blob/master/week6-RNNs%2BCNNs/images/maxpooling.svg?raw=1\" width=\"550\"/>\n\n\n\n\n## Exercise\n\nIn this exercise, you will manually apply the operations of the convolution layer and pooling layer on two images. The diagram below shows the order of those operations:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lcharlin/80-629/blob/master/week6-RNNs%2BCNNs/images/exercise.svg?raw=1\" width=\"650\"/>\n\nThe kernels (filters) are 3x3 matrices:\n```\nkernel1 = [[0, 0, 0],\n           [1, 1, 1],\n           [0, 0, 0]]\n\nkernel2 = [[1, 0, 0],\n           [0, 1, 0],\n           [0, 0, 1]]\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lcharlin/80-629/blob/master/week6-RNNs%2BCNNs/images/kernels.svg?raw=1\" width=\"250\"/>\n\nThe input images are:\n```\nimage1 = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n          [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n          [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nimage2 = [[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n          [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n          [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n          [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n          [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]]\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lcharlin/80-629/blob/master/week6-RNNs%2BCNNs/images/input_images.svg?raw=1\" width=\"350\"/>\n\n1. For each input image, calculate the outputs of the convolution layer and the max-pooling layers. Note the strides in the convolution layer.\n2. How these two kernels differentiate between different images?\n3. If this pipeline is a part of a convolutional neural network, how many learned parameters are there?\n4. This pipeline is different from a convolutional neural network, i.e. it misses a few components. What are teh missing components?\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"CNNs_Questions.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
