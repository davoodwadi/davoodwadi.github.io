Preliminaries\n\nBefore we jump into the value and policy iteration excercies, we will test your comprehension of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). <br>\n\n### 0.1 Tic-Tac-Toe\n\nLet's take a simple example: Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os). Definition: it is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.\n\n**Question:** Imagine you were trying to build an agent for this game. Let's try to describe how we would model it. Specifically, what are the states, actions, transition function and rewards?\n\nStates:\n\nActions:\n\nReward:\n\nTransition Probabilities:\n\n### 0.2 Recommender Systems\n\n**Question:** In the last class we discussed recommender systems. Imagine that you would like to model the recommendation process over time as an MDP. How would you do it?\n\nStates:\n\nActions:\n\nReward:\n\nTransition Probabilities:\n\n## 1. Value Iteration\n\nThe exercises will test your capacity to **complete the value iteration algorithm**.\n\nYou can find details about the algorithm at slide 46 of the [slide](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lcharlin/courses/80-629/slides_rl.pdf) deck. <br>\n\nThe algorithm will be tested on a simple Gridworld similar to the one presented at slide 12.\n\n### 1.1 Setup\n\nLet's set some variables. <br>\n`SMALL_ENOUGH` is a threshold we will utilize to determine the convergence of value iteration<br>\n`GAMMA` is the discount factor denoted $\\gamma$ in the slides (see slide 36) <br>\n`ALL_POSSIBLE_ACTIONS` are the actions you can take in the GridWold, as in slide 12. In this simple grid world, we will have four actions: Up, Down, Right, Left. <br>\n`NOISE_PROB` defines how stochastic the environement is. It is the probability that the environment takes you where a random action would.\n\n## *Note.* The value iteration algorithm is not accounting for stochastic transitions.\nNeed to set `NOISE_PROB=0`\n\nNow we will set up a the Gridworld. <br>\nIt has the following Rewards:\n\nThere are three absorbing states: (0,3),(1,3), and (1,1)\n\nNext, we will define a random inital policy $\\pi$. <br>\nRemember that a policy maps states to actions $\\pi : S \\rightarrow A$.\n\nNote that there is no policy in the absorbing/terminal states (hence the Not Available \"N/A\").\n\nNext, we will randomly initialize the value fonction\n\nNote that we set to Null the values of the terminal states. <br>\nFor the print_values() function to compile, we set them to 0.\n\n### 1.2 Value iteration algorithms - code completion\n\nYou will now have to complete the Value iteration algorithm. <br>\nRemember that, for each iteration, the value of each state s is updated using:\n\n$$\nV(s) = \\underset{a}{max}\\big\\{ \\sum_{s'}  p(s'|s,a)(r + \\gamma*V(s') \\big\\}\n$$\nNote that in the current gridWorld, $p(s'|s,a)$ is deterministic. <br>\nAlso, remember that in value iteration, the policy is implicit. <br> Thus, you don't need to update it at every iteration. <br>\nRun the algorithm until convergence.\n\n\n# *Note.* If `NOISE_PROB>0` there's a posibility of getting stuck as non-terminal states due to the calculation of $v$ based on a deterministic environment.\n\nNow that the value function is trained, use it to find the optimal policy.\n\nNow print your policy and make sure it leads to the upper-right corner which is the termnial state returning the most rewards.\n\n## 2. Policy Iteration\n\nYou will be tested on your capacity to **complete the poliy iteration algorithm**. <br>\nYou can find details about the algorithm at slide 47 of the slide deck. <br>\nThe algorithm will be tested on a simple Gridworld similar to the one presented at slide 12. <br>\nThis Gridworld is however simpler because the MDP is deterministic. <br>\n\nFirst we will define a random inital policy. <br>\nRemember that a policy maps states to actions.\n\nNext, we will randomly initialize the value fonction\n\nNote that we set to Null the values of the terminal states. <br>\nFor the print_values() function to compile, we set them to 0.\n\n### 2.2 Policy iteration - code completion\n\nYou will now have to complete the Policy iteration algorithm. <br>\nRemember that the algorithm works in two phases. <br>\nFirst, in the *policy evaluation* phase, the value function is update with the formula:\n\n$$\nV^\\pi(s) =  \\sum_{s'}  p(s'|s,\\pi(s))(r + \\gamma*V^\\pi(s')\n$$\nThis part of the algorithm is already coded for you. <br>\n\nSecond, in the *policy improvement* step, the policy is updated with the formula:\n\n$$\n\\pi'(s) = \\underset{a}{arg max}\\big\\{ \\sum_{s'}  p(s'|s,a)(r + \\gamma*V^\\pi(s') \\big\\}\n$$\n\nThis is the part of code you will have to complete. <br>\n\nNote that in the current gridWorld, p(s'|s,a) is deterministic. <br>\nRun the algorithm until convergence.\n\n# We have to set `noise_prob=0` or else the policy evaluation will not converge (values would be 0 for all states)\n\nNow print your policy and make sure it leads to the upper-right corner which is the termnial state returning the most rewards.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"value_and_policy_iteration_question.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
